The Category Column does simply, what the name says; it will show excerpts of the latest posts in your sidebar.

== Description ==

The Category Column is mainly designed to give your blog a bit more of a newspaper behaviour. E.g. The plugin shows the latest posts from all categories with an offset of three posts (which are in the main column) on our homepage.

If there is a post thumbnail, it will be displayed above the headline of the post. No further text will appear. If there is no thumbnail, only the headline and the excerpt of the post will be shown. When the plugin can detect neither the thumbnail nor the excerpt of a post, it will display just the first couple of sentences (or words) of a post.

The Category Column was tested up to WP 3.4. It should work with versions down to 2.7 but was never tested on those.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `category-coloumn` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory (I know, I made a spellingmistake on submission) ;)
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Place and customize your widgets
4. Ready

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I styled the widget container myself and it looks bad. What do I do? =

The styling of the widget requires some knowledge of css. If you are not familiar with that, try adding

`padding: 10px;
margin-bottom: 10px;`
 
to the style section.

= My widget should have rounded corners, how do I do that? =

Add something like

`-webkit-border-top-left-radius: 5px;
-webkit-border-top-right-radius: 5px;
-moz-border-radius-topleft: 5px;
-moz-border-radius-topright: 5px;
border-top-left-radius: 5px;
border-top-right-radius: 5px;`
 
to the widget style. This is not supported by all browsers yet, but should work in almost all of them.

= My widget should have a shadow, how do I do that? =

Add something like

`-moz-box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #888888;
-webkit-box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #888888;
box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #888888;`
 
to the widget style to get a nice shadow down right of the container. This is not supported by all browsers yet, but should work in almost all of them.
